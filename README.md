A responsive personal portfolio template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is intended as a starter portfolio that highlights skills, projects, education and contact details.
## How to run

- Mobile-first responsive layout with a hamburger navigation.
- Simple form validation and simulated submission using JavaScript.
## Tech used
- HTML5 (semantic tags like `header`, `main`, `section`)
